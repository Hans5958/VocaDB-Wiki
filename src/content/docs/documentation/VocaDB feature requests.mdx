## Contributing to VocaDB

VocaDB's new feature development is tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/issues) on the [VocaDB GitHub](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb). This includes bug fixes. If VocaDB is lacking a feature that you are expecting, you may [submit a feature request](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb/issues/new/choose) on GitHub. Please use the search to make sure that the feature has not already been requested. If the feature request has already been submitted by another user, you may give a "thumbs up" vote on the issue to help us prioritize it further.

When submitting a new feature request/issue, make sure you include as much information as possible. You also need to explain why do you need that specific feature: what are the use cases? Explain step by step how would you imagine the feature would work.

Please understand that unless the feature is extremely simple or requested by a very large number of users, it will take a long time for it to be implemented. Implementing a single feature may take anything from 1 hour to many weeks of concentrated work.

**You're more than welcome to recruit another programmer to help with the implementation, if you cannot do it yourself.** VocaDB is open source, just fork and send a pull request.

## For programmers / developers

Take a look at the code and instructions in [this README](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb#readme) on the [VocaDB GitHub](https://github.com/VocaDB/vocadb).

Any bugs and change requests are to be reported on the VocaDB GitHub, on the issues tab. If you think you could help, take a look at the list of reported issues, create a fork and you can fix it there and create a pull request back to the main repository.
