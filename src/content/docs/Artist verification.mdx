## Who?

If you are an artist working with music production, you may request your
**user account** to be connected to your **artist entry** on VocaDB.
Other roles such as illustrator, animator and mixer are also included.

**The requirement is that you need to have at least one song entry on
VocaDB**. This can be original song, cover, remix or music PV, as long
as it features vocals synths.

## Why?

As a verified artist your user account name is **displayed** on the
artist entry page, and vice versa. You also gain access to more
privileges regarding your artist entry. You may mark your artist entry
as **approved**, preventing new users from editing that entry. You may
also **remove tags** associated with your entry and provide **personal
descriptions** for your albums and songs.

Edits by verified artists are by default explanatory/trusted when
editing their own entries. For example, as a verified artist you may
mark the specific voicebank used without further explaining it - we
trust that you know what you\'re doing. **This means less work for both
you and the moderation team**.

## How?

You can do this by
[submitting a verification request on VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/User/RequestVerification).
**You need to provide some way to prove that you are the artist**.

- Post a tweet saying you want your account verified on VocaDB. To do this, use your artist Twitter account, to create a Tweet linking to your VocaDB **user** account (instead of your artist page).

For example: ![Artist verification example](/images/verification.PNG "Artist verification example")

- Temporary profile/video description texts work as well:

> My VocaDB account: https://vocadb.net/Profile/...

- The official website you're using for the verification must be linked to your artist entry. 

- Another way is to send a message to a site moderator. [Other contacting options](/docs/footer/contact).

- Your request will be rejected without proper proof! **Screenshots are not accepted.** Tweets or other public messages do not count, if they are not about artist verification.

Multiple artist entries (for example, circle or UTAU voicebank) can be
connected to the same user account (please mention this when submitting
the verification request).

Note that abusing these privileges is strictly forbidden: you may not
credit yourself for a song/album unless you really were involved.
