Entry reports are a way of keeping track and communicating various issues to moderators and relevant editors. 

[The list of entry reports](https://vocadb.net/Admin/ViewEntryReports) is visible to [trusted users](/docs/documentation/user-groups) and above.

- Trusted users should **ignore moderation-related reports** such as [artist verification](/docs/artists/artist-verification) and [content removal](/docs/other-guidelines/content-removal-guidelines) requests.

Entry reports can be sent anonymously â€“ user account is not required.

Reporting an entry sends a notification to the original editor. If the entry has been edited by **more than one person**, notifications are **not sent**.

For entries edited by multiple users, **specific entry version** should be reported instead: 
- Click ["View Modifications"](/docs/songs/song-entry-page#view-modifications).
- Go to the version where the error was first present.
- Click "Report an Error". 

When reporting mistakes, providing the **relevant context** by linking to the wiki is helpful to everyone.

**Relevant proof** should always be included in the report when appropriate.

## Goals of entry reports

Entry reports can have multiple goals:
- 1) **Tracking** issues that should be fixed.
- 2) **Educating** the original editor about the mistake.
- 3) **Alerting** moderators about various issues.

If **none** of these goals are relevant, entry report **should not be sent**. 

### Goal: Tracking

Entry reports can be used for **tracking issues** that should be fixed.

If an entry with mistakes is already **tracked somewhere else** (with [tags](/docs/secondary-entry-types/tags#editor-notes) for example), the entry report is probably redundant.

### Goal: Educating

It's preferable that edit mistakes are fixed by the editor who made them:
- 1) Fairness, "picking up after yourself"
- 2) More effective rule **learning**

After the entry report has been sent, the recommended waiting period for other editors is **at least 24 hours** before jumping in. Trusted users should not handle the entry report before that, if there is a **possibility** that the original editor will fix the issue and **learn** from it.

### Goal: Alerting

Entry reports can also be used for sending **alerts** to moderators.

 For urgent cases, it's recommended to also/instead ping "@VocaDB moderator" on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/3bwXQNXKCz).

## Entry report types

Using the correct entry report type is helpful. 

Albums and artist entries have four report types, while songs have an additional "Broken PV" type.

Entry reports sent for a **specific entry version** automatically use the "Other" -report type.

### Broken PV (for songs)

For reporting deleted or privated PVs.

[Region blocked](https://vocadb.net/T/8226) PVs should not be reported as broken PVs.

### Invalid or missing information

For reporting invalid or missing information in the entry. For example:
- Incorrect artists credits
- Romanizations/translations that do not follow the [Romanization Guidelines](/docs/other-guidelines/romanization-guidelines)

### Invalid tag usage

For entries that include incorrect tags. 

### Duplicate entry

For duplicate entries that should be [merged](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries). 

Note that artist entries **should not be automatically merged**, even if it's provably [the same person](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries#splitting-artist-entries).

### Inappropriate content

For entries [against the content policy](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy) that do not belong in VocaDB.

### Other (specify in notes)

For errors not already covered by the other report types.

## Unacceptable entry reports

### Questions

Entry reports are not for questions or discussions.

### New (album/song) entry requests 

VocaDB is volunteer-based collaboration project. Editor who created the artist entry is not responsible for keeping the artist discography up-to-date when new songs and albums get published. 

Instead if you don't want to wait, it's best to make an account and add the new entries yourself.  

### Improvement requests on existing entries

Entries that fulfill the [finished entry criteria](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#finished-song-entry-requirements) should not be reported to request additional information in most cases.

Lyric requests for example should be made with the [lyric transcript needed -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/6362/lyric-transcript-needed) instead.

Similarly, requesting taggings on entries is not accepted, unless the entry is approved (as those can be only tagged by trusted users and above). 

### Multiple entry reports of the same type

Spamming multiple similar reports is distracting and unproductive. Instead:
- A) List and mention the other entries within one report.
- B) Mention the other entries under the reported entry as a comment.
- C) Message a moderator with a list of entries.

## Handling entry reports

Invalid entry reports can be safely closed. Asking for proof and further clarifications under the reported entry is **recommended but optional**.

### Handling Broken PV -reports

Entries tagged with [region blocked](https://vocadb.net/T/8226) should be ignored.

- *Original* PVs should be marked as *Unavailable*.
- If the PV type is *Reprint* or *Other*, the link should be deleted. 

### Handling Invalid or missing information -reports

If the report is valid (and 24 hours have passed), the issue can be simply fixed.

If the report requires further investigation, the issue discussion should be moved under the entry. This includes reports that are hard to verify such as album information.

### Handling Duplicate entry -reports

Simple song entry duplicates can be merged.

Handling duplicate artist reports that require more nuanced approach should be left to moderators.

### Handling Inappropriate content -reports

If the report is valid, the entry should be deleted and the relevant editor messaged by a moderator --> report closed.

If the report is invalid (common with [cover unifier entries](https://vocadb.net/T/6751/out-of-scope-cover-unifier)), the content policy should be linked/explained in the comment section --> report closed.

### Handling content removal requests (mods)

If the [content removal request](/docs/other-guidelines/content-removal-guidelines) does not fulfill the necessary requirements, the entry report should be closed. 

If the report came from a user account, a message should be sent. Otherwise a message should be left under the reported entry.

### Handling artist verification request (mods)

If the proof is insufficient, close the report and send a message to the user.
